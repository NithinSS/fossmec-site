This part is for people who are unfamiliar with LINUX commands, if you have basic knowledge of Linux and know how to get around the system, feel free to skip this part. 

Basically there is no Open Source without linux, for becoming a developer the prime skills required for you is using the command line, that is the black box you type commands in. You can develop using windows too but it is most useful to have a Linux based system. Learn basic Linux Commands from here before proceeding.

Feel free to follow any of the course here.

# GIT and GITHUB

GitHub is where people build software. More than 21 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 56 million projects. It is in short a social network for programmers!

Now lets get into something technical, the website you're reading this on is GitHub. You ask what is github? Official statement is that "GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project"

So now lets put into simple words, Github is a platform similar to Google Drive, but instead of photos and files you upload your Software projects here, if you're developing a Operating System or Website you upload the Source Code here, for safekeeping, file sharing and collaboration. You can build the same software from people all over the world with GitHub.

So your first step into becoming a software developer is to learn git and learning to use github.
